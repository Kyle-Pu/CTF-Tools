# CTF-Tools
A suite of tools I'm creating to help out with CTFs!

## Programs
* rot13Decoder.py: Decoding strings using rot13, a letter substitution cipher.
    * Converts all letters to ASCII, shifts letters 13 units to the right (with a wraparound back to 'a' if the shifted letter goes beyond 'z'), and applies uppercase if the original string had an uppercase character in that position!
* MORE COMING SOON!!!

## References
* ASCII Table: http://www.asciitable.com/

### What I Like to  Use
I code in the terminal using vim
